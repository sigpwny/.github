### Who Are We?

We are the information security special interest group at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We run weekly meetings teaching people various topics from the ground up. Our club is made up of many people from a great variety of backgrounds and is multidisciplinary in nature. We strive to make all of our meetings fun and accessible to anyone interested in learning about computer security. We have a great [library of meeting slides](https://sigpwny.com/presentation/) and [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fWGYI7-Kt3Gi0aOIZMicg) that you can check out. 

### CTFs

In addition to teaching, we run a couple CTFs every year. In the late summer we run [UIUCTF](https://uiuc.tf/), which is open to anyone to play and has a large prize pool for both top teams and outstanding [writeups](https://sigpwny.com/writeups/). Check out some of the previous iterations of this event:

- UIUCTF 2022 [CTFd](https://2022.uiuc.tf/) and [repository](https://github.com/sigpwny/UIUCTF-2022-Public) of challenges
- UIUCTF 2021 [CTFd](https://2021.uiuc.tf/) and [repository](https://github.com/sigpwny/UIUCTF-2021-Public) of challenges
- UIUCTF 2020 [CTFd](ADD A LINK?)

We also run a CTF in the [fall](https://fallctf.sigpwny.com/) which is focused on giving students new to security a chance to play some more entry level challenges, connect with companies, and win prizes.

If you work somewhere who may be interested in sponsoring either event, you can find our sponsorship sheets for [UIUCTF](ADD A LINK), [FallCTF](ADD A LINK), and our contact information below.
