[SIGPwny](https://sigpwny.com/) is the special interest group for information security at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Our mission is to teach students cybersecurity through [meetings](https://sigpwny.com/meetings/), [competitions](https://sigpwny.com/events/), and [research](https://sigpwny.com/publications/). Our club is made up of many people from a great variety of backgrounds and is multidisciplinary in nature. We believe cybersecurity should be accessible to all, so our content teaches everything from the ground up.
