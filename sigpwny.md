### Who Are We?

We are the information security special interest group at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We run weekly meetings teaching people various topics from the ground up. We have a great [library of recorded meetings](https://sigpwny.com/presentation/) that you can check out. 

### CTFs

In addition to teaching, we run a couple CTFs every year. In the late summer we run [UIUCTF](https://uiuc.tf/), which is open to anyone to play and has a large prize pool for both top teams and outstanding writeups. 

We also run a CTF in the [fall](https://fallctf.sigpwny.com/) which is focused on giving students new to security a chance to play some more entry level challenges, connect with companies, and win prizes.

If you work somewhere who may be interested in sponsoring either event, you can find our sponsorship sheets for [UIUCTF](ADD A LINK), [FallCTF](ADD A LINK), and our contact information below.
