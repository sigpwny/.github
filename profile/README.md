[SIGPwny](https://sigpwny.com/) is the special interest group for information security at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Our mission is to teach students cybersecurity through [weekly meetings](https://sigpwny.com/meetings/), [competitions](https://sigpwny.com/events/), and [research](https://sigpwny.com/publications/). Our club is incredibly diverse, with members from varying disciplines and backgrounds. We believe cybersecurity should be accessible to all, so our content teaches everything from the ground up.

You can find our open-source projects and meeting content here on GitHub. We hope you will find these resources as valuable as we did.
